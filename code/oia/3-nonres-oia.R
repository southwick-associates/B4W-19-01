# get nonresident participation in Colorado
# - essentially we want a ratio between resident & nonresident (participants, days)
# - allowing us to estimate
#   + total nonres participants
#   + total nonres days
#   + total nonres (vs res) spending

# this will be quite some work, going back to the OIA survey dataset
# I did something similar on a previous project...do a bit of digging/thinking
