knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = NA)

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

```

## svyRate

These match with Eric's numbers

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
vrid_wt <- select(svy$person, Vrid, weight)
act <- left_join(svy$act, vrid_wt) %>% filter(is_targeted)

group_by(act, act, part) %>%
    summarise(n = sum(weight)) %>%
    mutate(pct = n / sum(n)) %>%
    filter(part == "Checked") %>%
    knitr::kable()
```

## waterRate

These look similar to Eric's, but a bit different, particularly for fishing and watersports. Note that water sports not being 100% might be expected for things like swimming: Some people might only do that in pools.

```{r}
filter(act, part == "Checked", !is.na(part_water)) %>%
    group_by(act, part_water) %>%
    summarise(n = sum(weight)) %>%
    mutate(pct = n / sum(n)) %>%
    filter(part_water == "Yes") %>%
    knitr::kable()
```
