
## Overview

For Southwick internal use only, this represents the analysis for the CO survey. Currently working on survey cleaning, particularly identifying suspicious respondents for potential removal (code/1-svy/3-flags.R & flag-summary.Rmd)

## Usage

The analysis can be run from `code/run.R`

### R Package Library

This project was setup using package 'saproj'

Certain files shouldn't be edited by hand:
- .Rprofile             specifies R version and project library
- snapshot-library.csv  details project-specific packages (if they exist)
